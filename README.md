The theme of this project is to create a device which will interlink our physical with digital world.
In this we decided to make a such device wich helps us in gaming so that we can actually feel that we are in gaming world.
The aim of this project is to control game with hand moments and gestures so that we can get a better experience of gamming. In this project ball's direction and force is controlled by using had moments. It is done by using from mpu 6050 accelerometer for force and direction while flex sensors for gestures and arduino for communicating with game with bluetooth.
this repo contains both arduino code and unity game. by default port was set to COM6 at 9600 baurd rate you can change this in pin.cs located in assets folder
sorry to say that this was just a demo type so code was not optimized well and game was not desinged with much graphics and rules but you can costimize it as you want. Due to some facotors we published it before taking it to full extent.
